# GravFInv3D

A wavenumber-domain iterative approach for rapid 3-D imaging of gravity anomalies and gradients.

Developed by Lianghui Guo and Yatong Cui.

# Prerequisites

The code being implemented in MATLAB, it requires the MATLAB software, which is licensed under the MathWorks sofware company. MATLAB can be downloaded at the following link https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/, and more information can be found about the license fee on the website.

# Usage

To launch the program, it just requires to dowload ‘Matlab_Code’ from my repositories and execute the script GMCurvature.m on MATLAB.
